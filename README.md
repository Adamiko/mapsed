# mappy.js

On **[my website](http://toepoke.co.uk/)** I needed to be able to select places on a map.  

I couldn't find anything that fully did what I was after so I built mappy (besides I need the JavaScript practice!).

In short it provides the following:

* UI for users to "select" a place (you get a callback detailing what they picked)
* UI for adding "custom" places
* Support for firing a map up full-window (without having to create a DIV on the page)
* Add searching to the map
* Add/Edit and update your own "custom places" (i.e. those the **[Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/)** doesn't know about, but you do
* Works with multiple maps on the same page

## Dependencies
jQuery (10.2 used in development)
Google Maps library (v3)
Google Places library (v3)

## Source code
The source code is knocked up to satisfy a need.  I'm not advertising it as best practice, but if you think it will benefit you, please feel free to use it.
mappy.js is released under a ''do what you like with it'' license :-)
